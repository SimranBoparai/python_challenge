* Create a new repository in  GitHub for the challenge

## Repository Setup 
Complete the following steps to create a new repository:
1. Create a new repository for this challenge called 'python_challenge.' 
2. Clone the new repository SSH Key to your computer.
3. Inside your local Git repository (Git Bash), create two separate folders: ' PyBank' and 'PyPoll'.
4. Inside each folder, add the following:
    - A new file named 'main.py' for the script.
    - A new folder named 'Resources' contains the CSV files used in the challenge. 
    - A new 'analysis' folder that contains your results text file.
5. Commit and Push these changes to GitHub. 

## About the Challenge(s)

Instructions
1. Download the 'budget_data.csv' file and move it to the 'Resources' folder within the 'PyBank' folder. 
2. Write a Python script to analyze the data in the 'budget_data.csv' and calculate the above values. 
3. The final script should print the values in the terminal.
4. Export the analysis as a text file within the 'analysis' folder. 

Challenge #2: PyPoll Analysis:

PyPoll challenge analyzes the votes in the given CSV file. Calculate the following values:
    1. Total Votes
    2. List of Candidates 
    3. Total number of votes won by each candidate

3. The final script should print the values in the terminal.
4. Export the analysis as a text file within the 'analysis' folder. 

## How to Run the Scripts 
1. Ensure Python and VS Code are installed on your machine. 
2. Navigate to the directory in Git Bash containing the 'main.py' scripts for both datasets. 
3. Enter code. in Git Bash to launch VS Code and run the script. The terminal should print the analysis.
